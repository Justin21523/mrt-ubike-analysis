# MetroBikeAtlas

Goal: build a production-minded, reproducible data pipeline and MVP web app to analyze Taiwan metro + shared bike flows and their relationship with city factors (district, land use/POI, accessibility, and time patterns).

Stage 1 delivers the project scaffold, configurable ingestion/preprocessing utilities, and a minimal FastAPI + map UI for exploration.
